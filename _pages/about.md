<p>
  I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at 
  <a href="https://stat.duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, with a strong research focus on 
  <strong>Bayesian statistics</strong>. Currently I am exploring topics on Bayesian Optimization with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/simonmak/home">Simon Mak</a> and Bayesian Clustering with <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Amy.Herring">Amy Herring</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  Prior to joining Duke, I earned my M.Sc. in Statistics from the 
  <a href="https://iitk.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK)</a> 
  and my B.Sc. from 
  <a href="https://rkmrc.in" target="_blank">Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur</a>. 
  Over the years, I have worked on a range of methodological and applied projects, spanning 
  semiparametric modeling, power and precision-based sample size calculation, and efficient MCMC diagnostics.

<p>
  During my time at IIT Kanpur, under the mentorship of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arnabhazra09/">Prof. Arnab Hazra</a>, I worked on proposing a semiparametric generalized exponential (GE) regression model with penalized complexity priors for capturing long-term precipitation trends in the Western Ghats.
Under the guidance of <a href="https://dvats.github.io/">Prof. Dootika Vats</a>, I explored the use of Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) for diagnosing convergence in MCMC algorithms, playing with a Stein-thinning approach to reduce computational burden and adapting it for biased samplers.

<p>
  In a collaborative project with <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/">Prof. Bibhas Chakraborty</a>, I derived sample size formulas for Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART) in the presence of skewed outcomes, incorporating both power- and precision-based criteria for full-scale and pilot study designs.
