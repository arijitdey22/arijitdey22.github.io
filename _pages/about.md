# About Me

<p>
  I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the
  <a href="https://stat.duke.edu" target="_blank">Department of Statistical Science</a> at Duke University, with a strong research focus on 
  <strong>Bayesian statistics</strong>. Currently I am exploring topics on Bayesian Optimization with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/simonmak/home">Prof. Simon Mak</a> and Bayesian Clustering with <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Amy.Herring">Prof. Amy Herring</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  Over the years, I have worked on a range of methodological and applied projects, spanning 
  semiparametric modeling, power and precision-based sample size calculation, and efficient MCMC diagnostics.
</p>

<p>
  During my time at IIT Kanpur, under the mentorship of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arnabhazra09/">Prof. Arnab Hazra</a>, I worked on proposing a semiparametric generalized exponential (GE) regression model with penalized complexity priors for capturing long-term precipitation trends in the Western Ghats.
Under the guidance of <a href="https://dvats.github.io/">Prof. Dootika Vats</a>, I explored the use of Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD) for diagnosing convergence in MCMC algorithms, playing with a Stein-thinning approach to reduce computational burden and adapting it for biased samplers.
</p>

<p>
  I also collaborate with the <a href="https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/cqm" target="_blank">Centre for Quantitative Medicine</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/">Prof. Bibhas Chakraborty</a>. I worked on a project to derive sample size formulas for Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART) in the presence of skewed outcomes, incorporating both power- and precision-based criteria for full-scale and pilot study designs. Currently I am working on Q-learning for estimating dynamic treatment regimes from survival data.
