<p>
  I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at 
  <a href="https://stat.duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke University</a>, with a strong research focus on 
  <strong>Bayesian statistics</strong>. Currently I am exploring topics on Bayesian Optimization and Bayesian Clustering.

  Prior to joining Duke, I earned my M.Sc. in Statistics from the 
  <a href="https://iitk.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK)</a> 
  and my B.Sc. from 
  <a href="https://rkmrc.in" target="_blank">Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur</a>. 
  Over the years, I have worked on a range of methodological and applied projects, spanning 
  semiparametric modeling, power and precision-based sample size calculation, and efficient MCMC diagnostics.
