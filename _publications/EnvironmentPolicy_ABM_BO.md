excerpt: "This paper introduces a machine-learning–assisted framework for optimizing environmental policy in complex agent-based models. By combining statistical sensitivity testing with Bayesian optimization, it enables efficient policy search despite costly simulations. Applied to an extended Sugarscape model with pollution, the approach identifies interpretable policies and reveals key tradeoffs between welfare, inequality, and survival."
