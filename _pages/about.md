  I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, with a strong research interest in Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and clinical trial design.</p>

    <p> Prior to joining Duke, I earned my M.Sc. in Statistics from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) and my B.Sc. from Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur. Over the years, I have worked on a range of methodological and applied projects, spanning semiparametric modeling, power and precision-based sample size calculation, and efficient MCMC diagnostics.</p>

    <p> Currently, I am working on extending statistical methods for analyzing skewed outcomes in Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART), and exploring computationally scalable techniques in high-dimensional Bayesian inference.</p>
