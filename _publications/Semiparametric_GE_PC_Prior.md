excerpt: "In this paper, we analyzed of precipitation data in the Western Ghats region from 1901 to 2022 by developing a semiparametric GE regression model that extends the GE distribution to a regression setting. We also constructed a novel class of penalized complexity prior for the shape parameter of the GE distribution."
